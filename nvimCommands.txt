---------------------------------I am currently using NvChad----------------------------

-To list down the buffers: `:ls!`
-To give the buffer a name: first open the buffer and being in terminal mode type `:file <myservername>`
-To open the buffers out of the list: `:b(uffer) <bufferno./buffername>`
-To help/know more about deleting buffer: `:h bdelete`
-To delete all the buffers at once: `%bdelete`
NOTE: sometimes the swap files conflicts with the actual file(which may conflict with the variables/functions/objects/classes etc), just delete the swap files present, that should solve the problem 
-To see the warnings/error(diagnostics) that goes out of the screen: `]d`
-clangd doesn't support utf-16, to make it support add this to the lspconfig.lua, or else a warning would keep on appearing whenever a symbol is typed: 
```
lspconfig.clangd.setup {
  on_attach = on_attach,
  capabilities = capabilities,

  -- offset encoding warning https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/12qbcua/multiple_different_client_offset_encodings/
  cmd = {
    "clangd",
    "--offset-encoding=utf-16",
  }
}```
