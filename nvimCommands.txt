---------------------------------I am currently using NvChad----------------------------

-To list down the buffers: `:ls!`
-To list down the buffers using telescope: "<leader>fb"
-To give the buffer a name: first open the buffer and being in terminal mode type `:file <myservername>`
-To open the buffers out of the list: `:b(uffer) <bufferno./buffername>`
-To help/know more about deleting buffer: `:h bdelete`
-To delete all the buffers at once: `%bdelete`
NOTE: sometimes the swap files conflicts with the actual file(which may conflict with the variables/functions/objects/classes etc), just delete the swap files present, that should solve the problem 
-To see the warnings/error(diagnostics) that goes out of the screen: `]d` or `[d`
-clangd doesn't support utf-16, to make it support add this to the lspconfig.lua, or else a warning would keep on appear whenever a symbol is typed: 
```
lspconfig.clangd.setup {
  on_attach = on_attach,
  capabilities = capabilities,

  -- offset encoding warning https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/12qbcua/multiple_different_client_offset_encodings/
  cmd = {
    "clangd",
    "--offset-encoding=utf-16",
  }
}```
-To change the code comments default color, add this to your highlights.lua:
```M.override = {
  Comment = {
    italic = true,
    fg = "#4dde21"//your desired color
  },
}```
-To move the cursor being in the Insert mode: <C-h/j/k/l> (depends on where you want to move, left/down/up/right respectively) 
-To toggle between Insert/Command mode for only one task(helpful when you want to edit just one thing but dont want to switch back and forth between Insert/command mode manually): being in Insert/command mode press <C-o> (NOTE: it will toggle back to the previous mode it was in after one command)
-Alternative to <Esc> to go to command mode: <C-[> (very handy)
-Go to the end of the line and get into insert mode: <A>
-Go to the end of the line but stay in command mode: $
-Go to the start of the line and get into insert mode: <I>
-Go to the start of the line but stay in command mode: 0
